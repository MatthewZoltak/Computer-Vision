The path variable name is 'pathVariable'
I currently have pathVariable = '/content/drive/MyDrive/ecse415/images/'

Libraries used:
google==2.0.3
matplotlib==3.2.2
opencv-contrib-python==4.1.2.30
opencv-python==4.1.2.30
numpy==1.19.5
mpmath==1.2.1

the imports are made in the first cell. I used drive.mount to import the images because I used google.colab... you can remove this line
